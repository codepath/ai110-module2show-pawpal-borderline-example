# PawPal+ Project Reflection

## 1. System Design

**a. Initial design**

My initial design included four classes: Owner, Pet, Task, and Scheduler. The Owner holds pets, the Pet holds tasks, and the Scheduler is responsible for organizing the tasks. The Task class stores basic task information.


**b. Design changes**

I did not make many changes to my design. I mostly kept the same structure as I planned in the beginning. Some small adjustments were made while coding, but nothing major.

## 2. Scheduling Logic and Tradeoffs

**a. Constraints and priorities**

My scheduler considers tasks and returns them. I mainly focused on organizing tasks for the owner. I did not include many constraints.

**b. Tradeoffs**
One tradeoff is that the scheduler is simple and does not handle complex cases. 

## 3. AI Collaboration

**a. How you used AI**

I used AI to help me generate some of the classes and functions. It was helpful for structuring the code and understanding what methods to include. I also used it when I was unsure about syntax.

**b. Judgment and verification**
There were times when I modified AI suggestions slightly to fit my project. I checked that the code worked after using AI. I mainly verified by running the program.

## 4. Testing and Verification

**a. What you tested**

I tested basic task creation and scheduler behavior. These tests were important to make sure the system worked.

**b. Confidence**

I am somewhat confident that the scheduler works. If I had more time, I would test more edge cases and different scenarios.

## 5. Reflection

**a. What went well**

The system structure went well and I was able to connect the classes together.

**b. What you would improve**

I would improve the scheduler logic and possibly add more features.


**c. Key takeaway**
One important thing I learned is that AI can help speed up development, but you still need to understand what the code is doing.
